## About The Project

This project is a web site that combines my personal information with a live weather dashboard for my home town Dhaka. The portfolio section shares a bit about my background, education, and experience and the weather section shows the current weather in real time using a public weather site.

Users can:

See the current temperature, location, and weather conditions.

View weather images that match the temperature (cold, mild, sunny).

Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

The app is built with React and styled with basic css, keeping the interface clean, modern, and responsive.

This project shows my skills in working with APIs, managing React states and hooks, and creating simple, easy-to-use interfaces that present real-world data in a friendly way.
